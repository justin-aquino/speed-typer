# SEI-0124 Project 1: Speed-typer: Keylometers/Second
## IDEA
For my first project in this course, I decided to build my version of a speed typing challenge. As a novice mechanical keyboard enthusiast, I enjoy building keyboards using different switches depending on what sound profile and feel I am looking for at certain times. And to test out the build, I always use websites like [monkeytype](https://www.monkeytype.com/) and [kbsim](https://kbs.im/).


## TECH STACK TO BE USED:
> I plan on using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap/Other CSS Frameworks, Favicon, and Javascript

## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
The words to be typed will be displayed one by one. Once the user types the word correctly, a new word will be generated (no need to press enter), and the score will be incremented by one. I will also implement a count down timer that will be incremented whenever the player types in the word correctly.

## Levels of Difficulty Explained:
MVP will only have Normal difficulty as default. Once the MVP goal has been reached, I will be adding more levels into the game. 

### Every word typed correctly will increment the timer by: 

#### EASY MODE
+ 5 seconds.

#### NORMAL MODE(DEFAULT)
+3 Seconds

#### HARD MODE
+ 2 seconds.

## MVP

1. Presentable and responsive design
2. 1 Level of Difficulty (NORMAL)
3. Randomly generate words and display using DOM Manipulation.
